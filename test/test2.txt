Speooh new the Rev. MARTIN LuTHER KING
At the "March on vYashington"
I am happy to join with you today in what will go down
in history as the greates•t demonstration for freedom in
the history of our nation.
Five ~core years ago a great American in whose symholic
shado·w we stand today signed the Emancipation
Proclamation. This momen:tous cleeree is a great beacon
light of hope to millions of Negro slave·s who had been
~e.arrd in the flames o[ withering injushcc. It came as a
joyous daybre,ak to end the long night of their captivity.
But 100 years late<r the Negro still is no•t fre·e. One hundred
years later the 1i.fe of the Negro is still badly
erippled by the manacles of s-t•grPg-ation and the chains of
discriminatio11. One hnndred years later the Ne,gro live·s
on a lone,Jy i:"]and of poverty in the mids1t of a va1S1t ooean
of matE>.rial prospc·rity. Out> hundred years later the
egro is still larugui~hed iu the comer~s o.f Ame·rican
~oci. ety and find;:; himself in exile in his own land. So
wo '''<' come hf'rP torlay to r1r.amatize a s,hameful condition.
In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash
a eheck. Whrn the a. reb it ects of our Re:publie wrote the
magnificent. wonls of the Constitution a.nd the Declaration
o1 Independence, they we·re signing· a promiss'Cl<ry note to
which eve·ry American wa:" to fall heir. 'I'his no,te was a
promise that all nwn-yc::;, bla,ek men as we11 as white
rmm-wonld he g1mnmtPt'd the unalienable rights of life,
liherty a]l(l the pnrsni1 of ha.ppine'Ss. It is obvious today
tha.t Amcri(·a lms <lcfaulted on this promissory note insofar
as hP>r citi7.ens of co.Jo,r arr concP:rned. Instead of
