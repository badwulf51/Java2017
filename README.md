Comparing two documents via threads 


Project is not done to my usual standard, ran out of time. 

How To Use Program: 
1.) Download and run in eclipse 
2.) The console will ask the user for two files, the files must be saved to the projects master root folder. The user enters two file names
    and the files are parsed. 
3.)Files are passed to threads and threads are also started.
4.) words are processed to the singles and associated hashes 
5.) at the end the program will tell you which hashes match 

Bugs, Problems and Missing Things: 
1.) Files cannot contain a line of white space at the top or else an error will occur 
2.) cannot get the proper strings to display at the end for the matching minhashes.
3.) Program does not display the "jaccard" percentage for how similar the two documents are.
